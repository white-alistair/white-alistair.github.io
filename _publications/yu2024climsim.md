### Abstract
Modern climate projections lack adequate spatial and temporal resolution due to computational constraints, leading to inaccuracies in representing critical processes like thunderstorms that occur on the sub-resolution scale. Hybrid methods combining physics with machine learning (ML) offer faster, higher fidelity climate simulations by outsourcing compute-hungry, high-resolution simulations to ML emulators. However, these hybrid ML-physics simulations require domain-specific data and workflows that have been inaccessible to many ML experts. As an extension of the ClimSim dataset (Yu et al., 2024), we present ClimSim-Online, which also includes an end-to-end workflow for developing hybrid ML-physics simulators. The ClimSim dataset includes 5.7 billion pairs of multivariate input/output vectors, capturing the influence of high-resolution, high-fidelity physics on a host climate simulator's macro-scale state. The dataset is global and spans ten years at a high sampling frequency. We provide a cross-platform, containerized pipeline to integrate ML models into operational climate simulators for hybrid testing. We also implement various ML baselines, alongside a hybrid baseline simulator, to highlight the ML challenges of building stable, skillful emulators. The data and code are publicly released to support the development of hybrid ML-physics and high-fidelity climate simulations.

I'm Alistair, a PhD student in the [Earth System Modeling group](https://www.asg.ed.tum.de/en/esm/home/) at the Technical University of Munich and the [FutureLab AI in the Anthropocene](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/institute/futurelabs/artificial-intelligence-in-the-anthropocene/) at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.
I am currently visiting the [Anima AI+Science Lab](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/) at Caltech.

In my research I develop methods for solving problems at the intersection of physics, numerical simulation, and machine learning.
Motivated by applications to weather and climate modeling, I am particularly interested in using physics to constrain deep learning models such as neural differential equations and neural operators.

Here's a non-exhaustive list of research interests: 
scientific machine learning, 
machine learning for weather and climate modeling, 
neural differential equations, 
neural operators,
diffusion models, 
reservoir computing, 
machine learning for dynamical systems, 
hybrid modeling, 
differentiable programming, 
all kinds of physics-based inductive biases.

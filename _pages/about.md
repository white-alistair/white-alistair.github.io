I'm Alistair, a PhD student in the [Earth System Modeling group](https://www.asg.ed.tum.de/en/esm/home/) at the Technical University of Munich and in the [FutureLab AI in the Anthropocene](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/institute/futurelabs/artificial-intelligence-in-the-anthropocene/) at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.

In my research I develop machine learning methods for solving hard problems in physics and, especially, climate modeling.
I am particularly interested in using physical priors to constrain deep learning models such as neural differential equations.

Here's a non-exhaustive list of things I'm interested in: 
scientific machine learning, 
neural differential equations, 
reservoir computing, 
machine learning for dynamical systems, 
deep learning for weather and climate modeling, 
hybrid modeling, 
differentiable programming, 
all kinds of physics-based inductive biases,
diffusion models.

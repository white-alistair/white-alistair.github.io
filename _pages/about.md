Welcome to my homepage.
I'm Alistair, a PhD student in the [Earth System Modeling group](https://www.asg.ed.tum.de/en/esm/home/) at the Technical University of Munich and in the [FutureLab AI in the Anthropocene](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/institute/futurelabs/artificial-intelligence-in-the-anthropocene/) at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.

I'm interested in developing machine learning methods for solving hard problems in physics and, especially, climate modeling.
To that end, I'm especially interested in combining neural networks with differential equations.

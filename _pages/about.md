I'm Alistair, a PhD student in the [Earth System Modeling group](https://www.asg.ed.tum.de/en/esm/home/) at the Technical University of Munich and in the [FutureLab AI in the Anthropocene](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/institute/futurelabs/artificial-intelligence-in-the-anthropocene/) at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.

In my research I develop machine learning methods for solving problems at the intersection of physics, numerical simulation, and machine learning.
Motivated by applications to weather and climate modeling, I am particularly interested in using physics to constrain deep learning models such as neural differential equations and neural operators.

Here's a non-exhaustive list of research interests: 
scientific machine learning, 
neural differential equations, 
neural operators,
diffusion models,
foundation models,
weather and climate modeling,
reservoir computing, 
machine learning for dynamical systems, 
hybrid modeling, 
differentiable programming, 
all kinds of physics-based inductive biases.
